Sometimes the mind is the only salvation from within, whenever the mind cannot get it from without. However, I'm more of a self-made computer scientist, than I am a self-made poet. I don't have very much of this at all. What I have here is what you get, until I come up with more as I go through life. Poetry isn't something that everyone has control over. poetry needs a credible, critical reason to be written down onto paper. Like, for example: You feel sad and abandoned by everyone, you thought loved you. Or you saw something in your dreams that amazed you, or dazzled upon something that triggered you to write that poem down onto paper. Poetry is written best, when its got feelings of whatever you feel inside you. First, write all your thoughts down, then have fun putting them all back together for the whole world to read... Just remember, they want to read your thoughts, through the actions you took to cause you to write that wonderful piece of poetry in motion. They don't want empty words, that posses no actions whatsoever behind their meaning. They want absolute truth with absolute reason. Get right to the point...

‚ÄòKnowledge‚Äô is a free invention of the heart and of the mind itself! The only textbooks needed are the heart and the mind. The only exam to be written is the key to ponder into wonder. For the heart and the mind hold the key to the greatest diploma of all, the dream‚Äôs creation of our imagination. For the heart and the mind are thus, the greatest teachers of us‚Ä¶ Believe in yourself! For you are their greatest student.

THIS BELONGS TO EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD Never give up your dream, no matter how far away it may seem to be, because that is when it is ever so close to becoming true. If you dream of something long enough and strong enough, your dream will come true, when you least expect it. Always remember, we are never too young or too old to dream and use our imagination, for we only get one and it is ours forever. May your heart be filled with courage and compassion, and your mind be as limitless and as wondrous as the universe itself! If you dream it, you can be it. Believe it!

Hello my friend. Please think of this Knowledge poem as if it were a portal into our dream‚Äôs creation come true. Please read it twice! And always remember: What's behind the light beholds the answer to all things possible! Everyone has dreams, but it's most important to keep them, even if they take an entire lifetime to come true...

Hello my friend. Please read this Knowledge poem and read it twice! I wrote these precious words through my very own tears of failure, when I thought I had lost my second chance at achieving my adult high school diploma, and in the same year 1997, I also broke two computers back to back; my own, trying to repair them. After writing this Knowledge poem, I achieved far more than I can ever be thankful enough for. I achieved my high school diploma in early 2001, and I never broke another computer ever again; I went pretty far with them as well. Since then, I wanted every single man, woman and child to have this Knowledge poem forever for free to unleash the tapestry of pure imagination, and to make everyone's dreams come true for them too! Please encourage others abound, even if you don‚Äôt know them or like them. Sometimes, we all need help to believe in ourselves again, especially when our dreams feel so broken that sometimes, it‚Äôs simply hard to believe in ourselves. This is my personal gift to all humanity, which was also my very own personal portal into my very own personal dream‚Äôs creation come true. Whoever shall read this Knowledge poem has already opened up a portal into their personal dream‚Äôs creation come truth...

Just one very important lesson to always remember: learn how to play again; that‚Äôs the key to ponder into wonder. That‚Äôs the key which makes all dreams possible! And that‚Äôs the only exam to be written‚Ä¶

The human imagination should never ever be bought or sold; by doing such, it will only dry up one day. Some things are supposed to be free. Some things are just too priceless to buy. Some things are just too precious to sell. Some things just have to be free to all humanity period! Since the inception of this Knowledge poem, I made it a humanitarian right to have these priceless, precious words forever, for free...

This Knowledge poem will never ever be bought or sold to anyone, which means it could also remain unpublished forever. May your heart be filled with courage and compassion, and your mind be as limitless and as wondrous as the universe itself! If you dream it, you can be it. Believe it! Your imagination can take you far. It just depends on how much you let it expand...

Science is not just for smart people from a university. Science can and often does happen for anyone. All you really need is a bit of imagination and a whole lot of trial and error. Anyone can achieve anything they so wish. All you have to do is believe in yourself, while you make all kinds of mistakes along the way. Sooner or later, what doesn't work now will eventually work out, when you least expect it. Science and discovery is all about trial and error. So don't become discouraged when something won't work out right. Give it some time, before you know it, you will start to see the sparks fly...

And as far as mistakes go, you are going to be in for quite the wild ride and a rude awakening if you think that you can stave them. Yet, always remember that mistakes are simply hidden teachers in discrete disguise. if you don't make mistakes, you won't learn. If you find you are making too many mistakes, walk away from the forest to see the trees. Don't give up! Take a Break instead! You will see them trees and when you do, the sparks will start to fly...

Don't be afraid of making mistakes, they are our greatest lessons through life. When we learn from them, they become our greatest teachers through life and we become their greatest, lifelong student...

Always remember that mistakes are Hidden Teachers in discrete disguise. So don't ever be afraid of making mistakes; they always teach us something, while we unwittingly achieve closer to our accomplished goal...

It's because of mistakes that things are possible to achieve. It's because of mistakes that keep us at a humble stance, not getting careless or dangerous with the things we learn and do. Mistakes are very important byproducts of everything we venture into. The mistakes we make can lead to a far greater understanding and knowledge than we had ever anticipated. Imagine that?
